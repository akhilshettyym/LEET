Selection Sort: Theory
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part is empty, and the unsorted part is the entire array. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element in the unsorted part, gradually growing the sorted section.

Steps of Selection Sort
Initialization:
Start with an unsorted array and divide it into two logical parts:

Sorted part: Initially empty.
Unsorted part: The entire array.
Find the Minimum:
In each pass, identify the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array.

Swap:
Swap the smallest element found with the first element of the unsorted part.

Update the Boundary:
Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts one element to the right.

Repeat:
Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.
